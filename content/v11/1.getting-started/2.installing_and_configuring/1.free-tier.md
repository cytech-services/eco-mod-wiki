::steps{level="4"}

#### Download and install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download)

#### Open Unity Hub and click the `Installs` tab on the left side

#### Click the `Install Editor` button to add a new version of Unity

#### Check the `ProjectVersion.txt` file in the ModKit directory, you will need to install a version of Unity that matches the year and first number exactly, but matching or higher than the third number is OK.
Example contents:
```text [ProjectVersion.txt]
m_EditorVersion: 2023.2.13f1
m_EditorVersionWithRevision: 2023.2.13f1 (70197a359f36)
```
In this example, you would need to install Unity 2023.2.13 or higher.

#### If you do not see the exact version you need, click `Archive` tab at the top of the page, then click the link `download archive` to see all available versions of Unity.
In this example you will need to click the year 2023, then find version 2023.2.13 and click the `Install` button to install it.

#### After the installation is complete, click the `Projects` tab on the left side of Unity Hub

#### Click the `+ New Project` button at the top right of the page

#### Choose the editor version you just installed from the dropdown at the top

#### Select the `3D (Built-In Render Pipeline)` template

#### Name your project and choose a location to save it, then click the `Create` button

#### After the project opens, go to `Assets` > `Import Package` > `Custom Package...`

#### In the Import Unity Package dialog, make sure everything is selected and click the `Next` button at the bottom right

#### In the next screen of the Import Unity Package dialog, make sure everything is selected and click the `Import` button at the bottom right
*Importing can take a few minutes depending on the speed of your computer*

#### Click the `Unity Registry` tab at the top left of the Package Manager window

#### Search for "Collections" in the search box, select it in the list, then click the `Install` button

#### In your `Project` window, right-click the `Assets` folder and select `Create` > `Folder`, name the new folder something relevant like `MyMods`

#### Right-click the new folder you just created and select `Create` > `Scene`, name the new scene something relevant like `MyModScene`

#### Double-click the new scene you just created to open it

#### In the `Hierarchy` window, delete the `Main Camera` and `Directional Light` objects that are there by default

#### In the `Hierarchy` window, right-click the empty space and select `Create Empty`, name the new object `Items`
This is where you will add all the items that define the icons, as well as the 3D models for tools.

#### In the `Hierarchy` window, right-click the empty space and select `Create Empty`, name the new object `Objects`
This is where you will add all the world objects like workbenches, doors, power generators, vehicles etc...

#### Name your project something relevant like `MyMod`, choose a location to save it, then click `Create`

#### On the next screen, select `.NET 8.0 (Long Term Support)` from the `Framework` dropdown, then click `Create`

![Reference Manager Dialog Screenshot](/images/screenshots/vs-select-eco-reference-asemblies.png)

#### Right-click your mod in the `Solution Explorer` window and select `Properties`

#### In the `Properties` tab, select the `Build` section on the left, then select `Events`

#### Navigate to the `Post-build event` section and enter the following commands

```batch
cd $(TargetDir)
del *.pdb
del *.config
del Eco*
del *.json
del A*
del B*
del C*
del D*
del F*
del G*
del H*
del I*
del J*
del K*
del L*
del M*
del N*
del O*
del P*
del Q*
del R*
del S*
del T*
del U*
del V*
del W*
del X*
del Y*
del Z*
```

#### Remove the command that correlates to deleting files that start with the same letter as your mod name
For example, if your mod is named `MyMod`, remove the line that says `del M*`.
This will ensure that your mod DLL is not deleted during the post-build event.

::note
When building your mod DLL, you may see warnings that it could not find directories or files to delete. This is expected behavior and can be ignored.
::

#### Test building your mod by clicking `Build` > `Build Solution` from the top menu or pressing :kbd{value="Ctrl + Shift + B"} on your keyboard
If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message in the `Output` window that says something like:
```text
========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========
========== Build completed at 12:00 PM and took 00.546 seconds ==========
```

You can find your mod DLL in the `bin/Debug/net8.0` directory inside your project folder.

#### Your Visual Studio 2022 environment is now ready to use for developing your mod!
